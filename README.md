# The Seneca Falls Convention
### Project Overview
The Convention is coming to town! It’s going to be grand, spectacular! And the promoters
have chosen you to create the web page for it. Your job is to build something that people will
love to read, with information about guests and events. The success of the Convention
depends on you. If your page is beautiful, people will get excited and come. If not… well, let’s
hope this isn’t your last job.

### Display
● The Convention needs a splash page, something that will really draw in the visitors.

o Show the highlights of the Convention.

o Create a link to a guests page.

o Create a link to an events page.

o The content of the Convention is up to you. Choose something you like and
build the Convention around that.

● The Convention will need a guests page.

o Each featured guest should have a large section near the top with a bio and
times the guest will be speaking or meeting fans.

o Secondary guests can be listed afterwards with a shorter bio and their booth
numbers.

● The Convention will need an events page.

o Create a schedule of events for visitors to view.

### Enhancements
Allow the user to register for events. When the user goes into the events page, they
should see which events they have signed up for.

a. Create a “Register” button for each event. When the user registers for an event,
add the event’s name to a string of events the user has signed up for.

b. Create an “Unregister For All Events” button that will wipe the string
