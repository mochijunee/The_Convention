# The Seneca Falls Convention
### Project Overview
The Convention is coming to town! It’s going to be grand, spectacular! And the promoters
have chosen you to create the web page for it. Your job is to build something that people will
love to read, with information about guests and events. The success of the Convention
depends on you. If your page is beautiful, people will get excited and come. If not… well, let’s
hope this isn’t your last job.

### Display
● The Convention needs a splash page, something that will really draw in the visitors.

● The Convention will need a guests page.

● The Convention will need an events page.

### Enhancements
Allow the user to register for events. When the user goes into the events page, they
should see which events they have signed up for.

a. Create a “Register” button for each event. When the user registers for an event,
add the event’s name to a string of events the user has signed up for.

b. Create an “Unregister For All Events” button that will wipe the string
