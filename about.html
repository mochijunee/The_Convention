        <p id="summary">Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, two of the convention's organizers, met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention with their husbands. Stanton and Mott were excluded from attending on the basis of sex, so they agreed to hold a woman's rights convention. The 5 organizers of this convention are shown below, and you'll have the opportunity to meet them if you come.</p>
