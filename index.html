            <h4>SUFFRAGE</h4>
            <p>One of the topics that will be discussed during the convention is woman's suffrage. Women are prohibited from voting and are forced to stay away from politics. This is one of the many examples of the unjust way women are separated from men. If you feel strongly about this issue and/or want to help us advocate for woman's suffrage, please attend the convention!</p>

          <div class="text">
            <h4>RELIGION</h4>
            <p>Another topic that will be discussed is the inferior role of women in the church. Women should not be excluded in the church and expected to remain silent. To resolve this, men should give women the opportunity to speak on moral and religious ideas during assemblies and gatherings. If you agree with equality in the church, show your support at the convention.</p>

            <h4>EDUCATION</h4>
            <p>Women are prohibited from participating in education and economy. The idea that women are intellectually inferior to men is degrading and wrong, as women should be able to receive an education and enter the workforce. Women are confined to their domestic spheres, forcing them to live as an obedient housewife for their husbands. If you agree with equality in education and jobs, show your support at the convention.</p>
